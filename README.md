# Hey-Taxi
Background: 

Taxi sharing culture is growing up around the world, it helps passengers to reduce cost and drivers to earn more. Though Bangladesh has lots of taxi and also people likes taxi rides but taxi sharing is not familiar to us. We wanted to create a taxi sharing culture in Bangladesh. We have find out the problems why taxi sharing is not possible in our country, that’s why we want to provide a system which will remove the difficulties and make taxi sharing easier and popular.

Existing problem and our solution: 

Lack of communication between cab drivers and passengers is the main reason why taxi sharing is not familiar in our country. Also There is no system that can provide information about taxi location or passenger location. And security is a major issue.

Our target is to create apps to help taxi drivers fill seats and to help passengers enjoy shared rides with faster, safer, and more cost and time efficient journeys. Our app ( heyTaxi ) will build a better communication between passengers and drivers. We will provide taxi’s map location to the users. User will be able to send pick up request to drivers, where he will be able to mention that whether he want to share the ride or not he will also be able to see drivers rating and current number of passengers in the taxi. He will also be able to share his ride to social media to get co-passengers. On the other hand, drivers will be able to see request of users, users heat map (so he can decide where to go and earn more), contact with the passengers. So ensure security every user and driver will be verified by our system and user or driver will be able to share his current passion to social media. To ensure woman’s security we introduced woman’s only ride, by which if a woman want then she can share her ride only with woman’s.
